Reed Solomon From Scratch
---

Error correction codes can be found everywhere, from radio to barcodes. Reed Solomon codes are the Swiss Army Knife of error correction codes, and have been used in everything from spaceflight to QR codes.

In this project, you can find an implementation of an encoder and a decoder for the Reed-Solomon code used in QR codes (`RS(255,249)`).

More documentation here soon.
